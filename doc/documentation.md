# How bad

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a movie rating website. Users can review
any movie by giving it a score and optionally some comments. The movie
information is obtained from a web API such as [OMDb][1]. Users can also rate
movie reviews made by other users. This allows distinguishing good-quality
reviews programmatically, so they can e.g. be shown on the home page of the
website.

The website will be implemented using the [Scala][2] programming language and
the [Play][3] web framework. The finished product will be hosted on [Heroku][4],
using [PostgreSQL][5] as its database management system.
